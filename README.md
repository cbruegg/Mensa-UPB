There already exist a few Android apps for the restaurants of the University of Paderborn, yet I've found no one functional enough to be a daily driver. Some have a great design, yet lack image previews; others are outdated and don't work anymore as they rely on parsing the website of the Studierendenwerk.

Please find screenshots and more information about the app's features in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cbruegg.mensaupb).
