# Mensa-UPB

There already exist a few Android apps for the restaurants of the University of Paderborn, yet I've found no one functional enough to be a daily driver. Some have a great design, yet lack image previews; others are outdated and don't work anymore as they rely on parsing the website of the Studierendenwerk.

Please find screenshots and more information about the app's features in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cbruegg.mensaupb).

# Advantages of this project
Mensa-UPB works with the official API of the Studierendenwerk, so it's unlikely to break anytime soon.
I've also tried to make it use modern technologies, like Google's support libraries, Kotlin coroutines and many others. It's also written almost entirely in Kotlin, JetBrains relatively new language that's a more innovative alternative to Java, yet preserves Java-Interop as much as possible.
In addition to that, the app uses the new data binding feature and targets the Nougat SDK.

# Contributions
Contributions are of course welcome, but unfortunately an API key is required for communicating with the official API. It has to be put into the api_id.properties file in the root directory of the project.
